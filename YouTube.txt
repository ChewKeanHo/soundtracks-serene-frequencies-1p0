TITLE
🎧 | Serene Frequencies 1.0




DESCRIPTION
Now that we get the hang on the creation process, let's try something ambient and serene. That way, I can explore broadly first before drilling into a specialized one. Here we are, presenting my first usable track.

§ FAQ
━━━━━
(1) Can I use this music for my video?
┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄
**Sorry. BETTER NOT. Very risky.**

As of year 2025, the copyright for A.I output content is very murky in both East and West nations.

I deployed Udio as the "Cyborg Approach" which means I'm still in full control and the A.I. is only augmenting my natural capabilities.

You can use YouTube audio remixing or include it into your YouTube playlist. If there's any problem, don't hesitate to ping me over the community posts!

(2) Can you license the music for my project?
┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄
**NOT YET**

Not until I figure out how deal with "after-the-fact" guarantees or legal workarounds with Udio. Pre-mature licensing can backfire easily.

That's the only reason I locked my musics under my proprietary license for now.

(3) Is this another A.I. Slop?
┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄
**NOT REALLY**

I do listen to all my musics, edit, purge, and optimize them until it passed my quality baseline.

(4) Why A.I. & Not Directly Invest Into Music Instruments?

**A.I. IS CHEAPER, LESS RISKY, AND NEW TO EXPLORE**

I'm a tech guy specialized in semi-automatic technologies. Personally, I love music but asking me to fully throw more than USD100k just to create a few musics in this economy is too much to ask. Moreover, the minimum amount of time and effort required to reach professional level is very unforgiving.

Secondly, I'm a tech guy. Applied A.I. is part of my domain. I don't see a problem using it as a general purpose musical instrument. Besides, I did not restrict any professional musicians not to use A.I. unfairly. It's just personal opinions.

I just see A.I. is the next step forward and I want it to augment me; not resisting it and self-making myself obsolete.
